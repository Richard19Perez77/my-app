# Lost Forest RPG

A simple game of story and choices that can lead you to a life from your experiences and decisions.

## Get started

Make choices as you see you like and see what kind of person you become!

You will be given story choices and then I'll give an ending based on them, use the buttons to select a path that is based off of your decisions!

## Become something from your forest experience

I'd like this to be a fun adventure where you can learn from the forest and grow as a person!

## React Native

This is a development project to help me learn React, so as you read the code or play the game, have fun, I'll try to comment it well as I start expanding it, for the first version it may be one file to start, but I will start using more paradigms and architectures as I develop it.
